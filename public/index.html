              I saw a recommendation for Supreme Valeting on Instagram and I'm so glad
              that I did. Richard worked his magic on our car yesterday &amp; his
              attention to detail, care and professionalism shines through (pardon the
              pun‚ò∫Ô∏è). I don't think our car has been as clean since it rolled off the
              production line! If you're in the West Malling area look no further because
              he is an absolute gem. Thank you so much.

              Wouldn‚Äôt trust anyone else to maintain my cars. Does an amazing waterless
              wash on my old classic and brings it up like new. Goes above and beyond,
              cannot recommend enough!

              My first experience with supreme valeting was brilliant, im extremely happy
              with the interior and exterior results, also the customer service was
              outstanding! I will definitely be using supreme valeting in the future and
              will be recommending them to friends and family. üòÅüëç

              Richard gave my car an interior valet, I purchased the car a few weeks ago
              and the interior was in need of some much needed care. Very professional
              service, very well priced and worth the wait for him to fit it in. Thank
              you.

              Richard was polite and friendly, knowledgable and efficient. Richard arrived
              spot on time and worked thoroughly, leaving my partners car gleaming.
              Richard quickly responded to any questions I had prior to the day. He
              advised me on the best valeting option and his price was affordable for the
              brilliant job he did. This was a gift for my partner and left my partners
              car looking brand new! I would definitely recommend Richard and will
              definitely use him again!

              I have an old Citroen C1 that over the winter months unfortunately succumbed
              to quite a lot of mould on the carpets, upholstery and any other fabric
              elements in the car. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better deep clean, the car
              genuinely looks as good as new, so I would definitely recommend Supreme
              Valeting and will definitely be using them again!

              My car was pretty grim to be honest as it sat for over 14 months in the open
              after I got stuck over seas because of covid lockdown. A layer of moss had
              grown on the exterior with mould on the seat because of dampness. Called the
              mobile service Supreme valeting and they arrived on time outside my home and
              ready to get to work on a frosty morning. 2 hours, 30 minutes later and job
              done. And what a job it was , stunned to say the least. My 12 year old
              X-Trail looked brilliant, engine bay, boot area and seats all scrubbed fresh
              to a very high standard. Body, all glass areas and wheels gleaned Tina
              showroom finish. Use these guys, you won't be at all disappointed...

              I was skeptical at first‚Äîhow could a valet restore a set of heavily
              yellowed, cloudy headlights to looking brand new? The answer? Witchcraft.
              Richard arrived at my workplace as booked, and from the start, he was a top
              bloke. He took the time to explain exactly what he was going to do to my
              poor TT, throwing around words like ‚Äúsanding‚Äù and ‚Äúpolishing‚Äù‚Äîenough to make
              any car enthusiast a bit nervous. But the result? Absolutely flawless.
              Richard‚Äôs work cost me a fraction of what I‚Äôd have spent on two new
              headlights, and the transformation was unbelievable. If you‚Äôre hesitating,
              don‚Äôt. Book him now‚Äîthis man is the real deal.

              From the first email to payment, dealing with Richard and his team was
              great. We needed a full, deep interior clean on our family car. He
              understood what was necessary immediately and made sure they did a brilliant
              job. Extremely pleased with their work. Looks better than the day we picked
              it up from the dealership. I'm so glad I found them!

              Supreme Valeting were brilliant. Arrived when they said they would. Their
              quality of work was second to none. They completed the valet in good time
              and we‚Äôre very reasonably priced. Wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to use them again and
              recommend!
