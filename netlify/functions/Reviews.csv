Sara Jefferies,5,I saw a recommendation for Supreme Valeting on Instagram and I'm so glad that I did. Richard worked his magic on our car yesterday & his attention to detail, care and professionalism shines through (pardon the pun‚ò∫Ô∏è). I don't think our car has been as clean since it rolled off the production line! If you're in the West Malling area look no further because he is an absolute gem. Thank you so much.
Colin Fox,5,Wouldn‚Äôt trust anyone else to maintain my cars. Does an amazing waterless wash on my old classic and brings it up like new. Goes above and beyond, cannot recommend enough!
Harri,5,My first experience with supreme valeting was brilliant, im extremely happy with the interior and exterior results, also the customer service was outstanding! I will definitely be using supreme valeting in the future and will be recommending them to friends and family. üòÅüëç
LukeS-672,5, Richard gave my car an interior valet, I purchased the car a few weeks ago and the interior was in need of some much needed care. Very professional service, very well priced and worth the wait for him to fit it in. Thank you. 
FreyaB-32,5, Richard was polite and friendly, knowledgable and efficient. Richard arrived spot on time and worked thoroughly, leaving my partners car gleaming. Richard quickly responded to any questions I had prior to the day. He advised me on the best valeting option and his price was affordable for the brilliant job he did. This was a gift for my partner and left my partners car looking brand new! I would definitely recommend Richard and will definitely use him again! 
JamesB-853302,5, I have an old Citroen C1 that over the winter months unfortunately succumbed to quite a lot of mould on the carpets, upholstery and any other fabric elements in the car. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better deep clean, the car genuinely looks as good as new, so I would definitely recommend Supreme Valeting and will definitely be using them again! 
HuwW-28,5,My car was pretty grim to be honest as it sat for over 14 months in the open after I got stuck over seas because of covid lockdown. A layer of moss had grown on the exterior with mould on the seat because of dampness. Called the mobile service Supreme valeting and they arrived on time outside my home and ready to get to work on a frosty morning. 2 hours, 30 minutes later and job done. And what a job it was , stunned to say the least. My 12 year old X-Trail looked brilliant, engine bay, boot area and seats all scrubbed fresh to a very high standard. Body, all glass areas and wheels gleaned Tina showroom finish. Use these guys, you won't be at all disappointed...
Steve Clout,5,I was skeptical at first‚Äîhow could a valet restore a set of heavily yellowed, cloudy headlights to looking brand new? The answer? Witchcraft. Richard arrived at my workplace as booked, and from the start, he was a top bloke. He took the time to explain exactly what he was going to do to my poor TT, throwing around words like ‚Äúsanding‚Äù and ‚Äúpolishing‚Äù‚Äîenough to make any car enthusiast a bit nervous. But the result? Absolutely flawless. Richard‚Äôs work cost me a fraction of what I‚Äôd have spent on two new headlights, and the transformation was unbelievable. If you‚Äôre hesitating, don‚Äôt. Book him now‚Äîthis man is the real deal.
PAUL SWORDS,5,Great work 3 cars done all very dirty with lockdown dirt, all 3 looked like they had left the showroom. Top Job
KatM-57,5, From the first email to payment, dealing with Richard and his team was great. We needed a full, deep interior clean on our family car. He understood what was necessary immediately and made sure they did a brilliant job. Extremely pleased with their work. Looks better than the day we picked it up from the dealership. I'm so glad I found them! 
Elliot King,5,You're only got to see how clean Rich keeps his own van inside and out to know he's going to do a spot on job very friendly professional service highly recommended üëå
